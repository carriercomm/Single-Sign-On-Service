Lasso Setup


FTP/unzip Lasso Service and Lasso Admin files  into the appropriate directories
on the server.  These instructions assume they are at /var/www/sso_service and 
/var/www/sso_admin, you will need to adjust the virtual host configuration and 
paths in the following instructions if elsewhere. These instructions assume they
are installed on the same host but that is not necessary.  They also assume that 
both are being installed, however the Lasso service stands alone, the Lasso 
Administration Interface is an optional extra.

REQUIREMENTS

In short to run the Lasso Service you need a webserver with OpenLdap, SqLite, PHP5
and Memcached and Zend Framework.

The PHP5 needs to have the following enabled: ldap, SqLite, Curl, Memcache

These instructions are for installing on Ubuntu (9.10) with apache2 and will
need to be adapted for other environments.

If not already installed you need the following packages.


libldap-2.4.2
slapd
ldap-utils
libsasl2-modules-ldap
php5-ldap
memcached
php5-memcache
sqlite
php5-sqlite
php5-curl

OpenLdap is available from http://staff.osuosl.org/~jeff/openldap/el5/i386/ 
(or http://staff.osuosl.org/~jeff/openldap/el5/x86_64/ for 64bit)

LDAP SETUP

If installed remove
rm openldap-servers-sql-2.4.11-*
remove open ldap server overlays if required 

Add to /etc/hosts.allow
slapd:          127.0.0.1

This setup uses a slapd.conf configuration file.  However this is no longer the default 
option in Ubuntu 8.10 onwards so it needs to be enabled.

In file /etc/default/slapd set variable SLAPD_CONF to the path of the config file:

SLAPD_CONF=/etc/ldap/slapd.conf

Copy the supplied config file to this location:

sudo cp /var/www/sso_service/ldap/slapd.conf /etc/ldap/slapd.conf

edit the slapd.conf

Comment out the TLS items at the bottom.  Add these two lines:

rootdn    "cn=admin,dc=sso"
rootpw 2KZVyVdkmyNPBWTrrW+L5s1+zT/FCG/c

The password hash used should be created with slappasswd  and be the password you want to use for ldap administration.  
It will need to be used later so don't lose it!

cp /var/www/sso_service/ldap/sso.schema /etc/ldap/schema/

create directory /etc/ldap/slapd.d

Check the configuration file with slaptest
slaptest -f slapd.conf -F slapd.d

Change directory slapd.d ownership to user and group openldap
chown -R openldap:openldap slapd.d

Start ldap with
/etc/init.d/ldap start


Put the following into a file eg. sso.ldif

# sso
dn: dc=sso
objectClass: top
objectClass: dcObject
objectClass: organization
o: sso
dc: sso

# admin, sso
dn: cn=admin,dc=sso
objectClass: simpleSecurityObject
objectClass: organizationalRole
cn: admin
description: LDAP administrator
userPassword:: 2KZVyVdkmyNPBWTrrW+L5s1+zT/FCG/c

The password should be the same as the one in the ldap config file

run ldapadd -x -w yourpassword -D cn=admin,dc=sso -f sso.ldif

Remove the two lines form the slapd.conf for rootdn and pass

Start the ldap service
/etc/init.d/ldap start

run ldapsearch -x -b "dc=sso"- you should see

      # extended LDIF
      #
      # LDAPv3
      # base <dc=sso> (default) with scope subtree
      # filter: (objectclass=*)
      # requesting: ALL
      #

      # sso
      dn: dc=sso
      objectClass: top
      objectClass: dcObject
      objectClass: organization
      o: sso
      dc: sso

      # admin, sso
      dn: cn=admin,dc=sso
      objectClass: simpleSecurityObject
      objectClass: organizationalRole
      cn: admin
      description: LDAP administrator
      userPassword:: e1NTSEF9MktaVnlWZGtteU5QQldUcnJXK0w1czErelQvRkNHL2M=

      # search result
      search: 2
      result: 0 Success

      # numResponses: 3
      # numEntries: 2

MEMCACHED

Installing the packages is most of the work however it is disabled by default.  So edit file
/etc/default/memcached and set ENABLE_MEMCACHED=yes. Then start the service
sudo /etc/init.d/memcached start

ZEND FRAMEWORK

See http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/introduction.installation.html for download and 
installation instruction.  Both sso service and sso admin use Zend Framework(1.8 or later) 
so we suggest it is installed in a common location under the PHP include path eg. usr/share


VIRTUAL HOST SET UP

Separate virtual hosts are needed for the service and admin.  

Uncomment the NameVirtualHost? *:80 line in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Create files sso_service and sso_admin in /etc/apache2/sites-available using the following descriptions.
NB. APPLICATION_ENV needs to be one of production | staging | development | testing and will determine which
section of the config file /application/configs/application.ini in each site will be used by the application.

ssoservice.localhost and sso_admin.local will need to be added to the hosts file (/etc/hosts).

127.0.0.1       sso_service.local
127.0.0.1       ssoservice.localhost
127.0.0.1       sso_admin.local

<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        ServerName sso_service
        ServerAlias ssoservice.localhost
        SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV testing

        DocumentRoot /var/www/sso_service/public/
        <Directory />
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride None
        </Directory>
        <Directory /var/www/sso_service/public/>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride All
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
        </Directory>

        ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/sso_service.error.log

        # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
        # alert, emerg.
        LogLevel warn

        CustomLog /var/log/httpd/sso_service.access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/sso_admin.conf

<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        ServerName sso_admin
        ServerAlias sso_admin.local
        SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV testing

        DocumentRoot /var/www/sso_admin/public/
        <Directory />
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride None
        </Directory>
        <Directory /var/www/sso_admin/public/>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride All
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
        </Directory>

        ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/sso_admin.test-error.log

        # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
        # alert, emerg.
        LogLevel warn

        CustomLog /var/log/httpd/sso_admin.test-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>

The sites are then enabled using

a2ensite sso_service (or name of your virtual host file in sites-available)
a2ensite sso_admin

Then restart apache
sudo apache2ctl restart 

SETTING UP ORGANISATION IN LDAP AND APPLICATION CONFIGURATION 

Before being able to use the service and admin some basic setting up needs to be done in ldap.  
In the service files /ldap there are several ldif files.  Edit the Users.ldif with the name 
of your organisation for the admin interface instead of 'MyOrg' and the username and password (md5 hash of pasword) 
of the administrator.

The same organisation name needs to be put in sso_admin/applications/configs/application.ini 
sso.adminOrganisation = "MyOrg"

Then run ldapadd on  basic_structure.ldif and Users.ldif as described above.  You may also want to adapt and use other ldif files
in the application ldap directory.

Each application has an application.ini file which are standard Zend Framework Configuration files. 
The variables in these will need to be changed to match your environment and organisation.

You should now be ready to fire up http://youradminsite/ in a browser and log in with the admin user in
your Users.ldif file and then see a page showing the existing organisation(s).
