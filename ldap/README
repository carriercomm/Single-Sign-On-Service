Patching and Resetting LDAP
===========================

base_structure.ldif
-------------------

Top level LDAP entries for SSO.

test_data.ldif
--------------

Test data for UAT and development.

reset_ldap.sh
-------------

Clears out all entries and enter the base structure and entries. Use this to
drop your LDAP back to a base state, for example deployment or UAT. If you are
making changes to the base data (eg resources, policies, etc), export the data
to these files. Be careful to not include any custom data in here.

It looks in the following files for entries (in this order):
* Policy.ldif
* Organisation.ldif
* Users.ldif
* Resources.ldif
* Permissions.ldif

patch_ldap.sh
-------------

Loops through all ldif files that begin with 8 numbers (eg 20090910*.ldif) and
will ldapadd them in order from earliest to latest. This will be more useful
after release.
